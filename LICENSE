                           Personal General Public License (PGPL)

Version 1.0
Preamble

This Personal General Public License (PGPL) is a proprietary software license that grants limited rights for private, non-commercial use. It is designed to allow individuals to use the software at no cost while protecting the developer's intellectual property and commercial interests. By contrast, most proprietary licenses are designed to restrict your rights to use and share the software.

When we speak of free use in this license, we are referring to price for private use, not freedom. This License is designed to make sure that you can use the software for your own personal purposes without cost, but strictly prohibits modifying, distributing, or using the software for commercial gain without explicit permission from the developer.

To protect the developer's rights, this License forbids you from modifying, decompiling, or using the software commercially without authorization. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you use or share the software: responsibilities to respect the copyright and commercial interests of the developer.

For example, if you use this software for commercial purposes without a separate agreement, you are required to pay a penalty of 1500 USD to the copyright holder.

The developer protects his rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to use it for private purposes under these strict terms.

For the developer's protection, this License clearly explains that there is no warranty for this software.
